# README for Image Processing.py

What you need before running:

- Tkinter: Python GUI library, usually comes installed with python if downloaded from www.python.org
           if you don't have it you may download by following these instructions
	   https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

- PIL: Python Image processing Library, you may download this one through the terminal or cmd by typing in
       pip install Pillow

- Folders: In the same place where you save the program (Image Processing.py) you will need to have two folders
           with the following names "Not_Processed" and "Processed" (If you wish to have folders in a different
	   path from where your program is located, just modify line 14 to desired directory path. The zip file
	   comes with one picture in the Not_Processed folder for testing the program.

# How the program works

- Place pictures that you want to process in Not_Processed folders, these must be .png format. 
- Run Image Processing.py
- A window with the first picture and a text box for notes will show up
- enter comments about the picture in the box and hit enter
- Image will be moved to processed folder along with the comment entered in the box
- All comments entered in the textbox will be displayed next to the picture name in
  a file named "My Comments.txt" which will be located inside the Processed folder.
  There is no need to create this file, the program will create it for you.

# Shortcuts

- If you enter 'g' or 'G' in the comment box, "Good" will be added as a comment
- If you enter 'b' or 'B' in the comment box, "Bad" will be added as a comment
- If you enter "quit" in the comment box, the program will exit. You may also exit by closing the window.
